# The Green Lunar Revolution: Methods

**Methods: Principal component analysis and deep learning clarifies hormonal**

The lunar regolith sample (GLDS-XXX) statistical reanalysis using GAGE gene set enrichment correlation analysis, Principal component pathways correlation analysis with KEGG pathway library and changes to the ribosome and defence metabolism pathways using KEGG pathview. Linear models of all lunar locations broadly grouped vs the regolith simulant was used to calculate differential expression using DESeq2 and DEG list correlation with KEG, GO and Reactome was used to calculate changes in metabolic and signalling processes related to plant hormone signalling. Instead of separating the lunar locations or grouping the sample based on the plant phenotype instead we grouped all the lunar samples into one “Broad Lunar” group allowing us to formulate the Broad Lunar Regolith model of terrestrial differentiation.

_Summary of the different plant response to Regolith vs simulant._

GAGE analysis (**Figure X**) reveals suppression of Ribosomes as the major component of the data; they are vital for protein synthesis, and composed of RNA and protein subunits. The suppression of their expression can be analyzed using KEGG pathview revealing how ribosome biogenesis involves changes to subunit assembly. The DNA repair and replication system that generates two identical copies during chromosomal unwinding is suppressed along with the DNA synthesis, homologous recombination and DNA mismatch repair pathway. Glucosinolate biosynthesis genes are being suppressed in the lunar samples and producing sulfur-containing compounds for plant defence. Other parts of the Plant-pathogen interaction pathway are also affected which will alter the plants PAMP recognition system. The loci involved in 2-Oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, a process that generates ATP and precursor molecules is also suppressed along with core metabolic processes involved in Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. In contrast, it is only the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway that appears elevated in these GAGE analyses. Taken together the pathway analysis shows the plants are slowing their growth in a manner that in part resembles that of plants experiencing mechanical stimuli along with all the downstream nutritional deficits (REF).
