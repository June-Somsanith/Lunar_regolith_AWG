# Lunar Green Revolution: Conclusion

In conclusion, the reduction in CPS (GA precursor supply) and a reduction in GA3ox medicated GA activation. This combined with an increase of GA deactivation by both 2-carbon oxidation and methylation suggests a decrease in bioactive GA levels. The reduction in GA leads to the stabilization of DELLA proteins and activation of the plant wounding response. This will also cause a negative feedback loop that increases GA sensitivity by increasing the potential for GA perception by increasing levels of GID expression. These metabolic modelling results suggest a potential for the development of novel crop ideotypes through manipulation of the GA pathway. This raises the question as to whether the gain-of-function Rht dwarf wheat alleles resulting from polyploidy present an opportunity to engineer new crops that might be able to overcome these stressors. Taken together our metabolic modelling predicts that the plants GA levels are reduced, stabilizing DELLA proteins indicating that different response RHT alleles that have been developed in wheat may have an altered capacity to respond to the real lunar regolith. Hence polyploidy and the gain-of-function nature of the _Rht_ dwarf underutilized crop species with novel potential for new ideotypes that can overcome the alien stress provided by the regolith.

To cultivate crops on the lunar regolith, plants must be able to anchor their roots deep into the soil to obtain water and nutrients. To comprehend how removing the _Rht_ dwarf allele in wheat or restoring GA biosynthesis in rice roots can help crop roots grow deeper in the lunar regolith, we must first understand their significance in plant growth. The _Rht_ dwarf allele in wheat reduces the height of the plant, and it curbs the production of gibberellins, plant hormones that stimulate stem elongation. With the removal of this allele, wheat plants can grow taller, with longer stems, and deeper roots, as they can generate more gibberellins. Similarly, in rice, restoring GA biosynthesis in the roots can promote root growth, and targeting specific cell types or stages of development can facilitate the production of longer and deeper roots. Without this metabolic engineering of the cell GA levels the roots may grow slower and shorter, which limits the plant's capacity to access water and nutrients deeper in the soil or regolith. Thus, by removing the _Rht_ dwarf allele in wheat or restoring GA biosynthesis in rice roots or simply adding GA to the irrigation, the resulting plants can grow longer and deeper roots. These roots can help anchor them into the lunar regolith, enabling them to access the resources they need to sustain their growth. This could potentially facilitate sustainable crop growth on the moon, which is crucial for future human exploration and settlement.



**Transcriptomics predictions requires hormone quantification and other phenotyping data.**&#x20;

Prediction -> GA level are low

Prediction -> JA level are high

Prediction -> SA level are high

Prediction -> ABA level are high

Prediction -> Ethylene level are high

Prediction -> BR level are low

Prediction -> Cytokinin level are low

**In conclusion**, DELLA stability plays a critical role in regulating multiple hormone signals that affect plant growth, development, and defence mechanisms. Any changes in DELLA stability could have significant impacts on lunar farming, affecting the ability of plants to grow and thrive in a challenging environment. … _intentionally open ended…_
