# Our goal is to perform deep-learning analysis on the Lunar regolith data using a generalised Reolith vs Earth model. 

This repo contains counts created for the "Lunar_regolith" assay using the NF_core RNAseq pipeline (https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq). 


Can we use analysis of differential expression of the real regolith to find studies on Earth that are similar using the European Bioinformatics Instiuotes expression atlas data?
