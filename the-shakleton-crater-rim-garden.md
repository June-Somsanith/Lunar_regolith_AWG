# The Shakleton Crater Rim garden

Introduction:

In order for long term habitation of the moon to become a realistic option for humankind we will need to create a bioregenerative life support system that sustainably supplies air, water and food. Plants will almost certainly be part of this approach, especially as they address a further issue that is being increasingly recognized as critical for manned expeditions to deeper space, that of an environment that promotes a well-balanced psychology. The extended isolation inherent in spaceflight is now known to lead to reduced psychological resilience, with associated loss of efficiency, productivity and even the possibility of a catastrophic loss of crew morale or stability. Plants provide a connection to Earth that significantly alleviates this issue. A base where themes of plant biology are incorporated into as many aspects of the living and work areas as possible represents an approach that should provide an environment compatible with long duration off-Planet missions. The Moon is an obvious next target for such a long-term mission and so a moon base incorporating these ideas could have a key impact on the success of this kind of expedition. The lessons and insights gained from this project could also facilitate implementation on Mars or elsewhere.

Bioregenerative life support system\


1st Goal: A optimum location in a crater on the moon should be identified for the primary landing site (literature search recommended).&#x20;

2nd Goal: An autoCAD graphic design should then be created showing how the final design will ‘grow’ under, from, around and into the environment and how the theme of plants is enmeshed in the design.

3rd Goal: Develop the internal design to show how the liquids will flow, light and nutrients provided (where appropriate) and other practical issues will be resolved.

## Scalable Lunar Base Architectural Challenge

### Objective

Develop a scalable lunar base initially sustaining 5 individuals, with potential expansion capabilities to accommodate more than 500 residents. The design must integrate plants as a fundamental element, ensuring a constant and positive psychological effect on the inhabitants, alongside fulfilling basic human necessities such as water, air, and food.

### Essentials for Design

* **Integration of Plant Life:** Incorporate plant-based elements throughout the base's architecture. This not only aids in air purification and food production but also enhances the living environment, contributing to the psychological well-being of the base’s inhabitants.
* **Water, Air, and Food Supply:** Ensure a sustainable and efficient system for providing fresh water, breathable air, and nutritious food to support life on the lunar surface.
* **Scalability:** The initial design must comfortably support a crew of five, with the ability to expand and accommodate over 500 individuals. This requires modular design considerations that can be scaled up based on future needs and resource availability.
* **Psychological Well-being:** Recognize the importance of mental health by designing spaces that are not only functional but also offer comfort and stimulate positive emotions. The presence of green spaces, communal areas, and recreational facilities are key.

***

Our design philosophy hinges on creating a sustainable and expandable habitat that not only meets the physical needs of its residents but also fosters a positive and nurturing environment. Incorporating natural elements, especially plants, into the lunar base’s design is not just an architectural challenge; it's a step towards creating a holistic living space that nurtures both the body and the mind.

#### Engineer Challenge: Ensuring Optimal Ecosystem Health with Reporter Plants

**Overview**

Innovatively design and implement bio-sentinel plants integrated with GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and luciferase markers. These plants will serve as living indicators, revealing the real-time health status of ecosystems.

**Defining the Variables**

* **Plants:** Selection will focus on native species with a wide environmental tolerance and significant ecological relevance to target ecosystems.
* **Environments:** Diverse habitats ranging from agricultural lands to protected natural reserves, each with unique biotic and abiotic stresses.
* **Management Approaches:** Employ sustainable cultivation, monitoring, and data analysis techniques to ensure minimal disruption while maximizing insight into ecosystem health dynamics.

**Biologist Challenge**

Initiate cross-disciplinary collaborations to refine biological indicators, enhance reporting accuracy, and tailor management approaches to diverse ecosystems. This challenge calls for a synergy of ecology, molecular biology, and environmental engineering expertise.
