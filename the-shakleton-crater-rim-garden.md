# The Shakleton Crater Rim garden

Introduction:

In order for long term habitation of the moon to become a realistic option for humankind we will need to create a bioregenerative life support system that sustainably supplies air, water and food. Plants will almost certainly be part of this approach, especially as they address a further issue that is being increasingly recognized as critical for manned expeditions to deeper space, that of an environment that promotes a well-balanced psychology. The extended isolation inherent in spaceflight is now known to lead to reduced psychological resilience, with associated loss of efficiency, productivity and even the possibility of a catastrophic loss of crew morale or stability. Plants provide a connection to Earth that significantly alleviates this issue. A base where themes of plant biology are incorporated into as many aspects of the living and work areas as possible represents an approach that should provide an environment compatible with long duration off-Planet missions. The Moon is an obvious next target for such a long-term mission and so a moon base incorporating these ideas could have a key impact on the success of this kind of expedition. The lessons and insights gained from this project could also facilitate implementation on Mars or elsewhere.

1st Goal: A optimum location in a crater on the moon should be identified for the primary landing site (literature search recommended).&#x20;

2nd Goal: An autoCAD graphic design should then be created showing how the final design will ‘grow’ under, from, around and into the environment and how the theme of plants is enmeshed in the design.

3rd Goal: Develop the internal design to show how the liquids will flow, light and nutrients provided (where appropriate) and other practical issues will be resolved.

Architectural Challenge:

* Develop a scalable lunar base capable of initially sustaining 5 people but expandable to >500
* Base must incorporate plants throughout as an integral element of the design to provide:
* Food
* Air
* Water
* Plus a constant and ubiquitous positive psychological effect

&#x20;

Biologist challenge:

* Define plants, environments and management approaches
* Develop bio-sentinel GFP/luciferase reporter plants to reveal ecosystem health?

&#x20;

Engineer challenge:

* Make it all work
