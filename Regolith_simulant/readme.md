The CoSE large chamber was built at the request of Dr Nitin @JPL 
It contains a O2 sensor, CO2 sensor and 5 soil probes.

02 sensor
The cross sensitivity data shown below does not form part of the product specification and is supplied for guidance only. Values quoted are based on tests conducted on a small number of sensors and any batch may show significant variation. For the most accurate measurements, an instrument should be calibrated using the gas under investigation. The AO2 has been tested with a number of gases which may be present in automotive exhaust to establish their level of cross interference. 
GasConcentrationBalance%O2 Equivalent Carbon Dioxide, CO2 16%N2 <0.1 Carbon Monoxide, CO6%N2 <0.1 Nitric Oxide, NO3000 ppmN2 <0.1 n-Hexane2000 ppmN2 <0.1 Hydrogen, H2 5000 ppmN2 <0.1


CO2 sensor
The SCD4x is Sensirion’s next generation miniature CO2 sensor. This sensor builds on the photoacoustic sensing principle and Sensirion’s patented PAsens® and CMOSens® technology to offer high accuracy at an unmatched price and smallest form factor. SMD assembly allows cost- and space-effective integration of the sensor combined with maximal freedom of design. On-chip signal compensation is realized with the build-in SHT4x humidity and temperature sensor.   CO2 is a key indicator for indoor air quality as high levels compromise humans’ cognitive low power  and well-being. The SCD4x enables smart ventilation systems to regulate ventilation in the most energy-efficient and human-friendly way. Moreover, indoor air quality monitors and other connected devices based on the SCD4x can help maintaining low CO2 concentration for a healthy, productive environment. 
Soil sensors 


Product Overview The transmitter has stable performance, high sensitivity, fast response and stable output, and is suitable for various soil types. is an observation It is an important tool to study the occurrence, evolution, improvement and water-salt dynamics of saline soil. by measuring the soil The electric constant can directly and stably reflect the real moisture content of various soils. The volume of soil moisture can be measured The fraction ratio is a soil moisture measurement method that conforms to current international standards. Can be buried in the soil for a long time, resistant to long-term electricity Solution, corrosion resistance, vacuum potting, completely waterproof. The transmitter is suitable for soil moisture monitoring, scientific experiments, watersaving irrigation, greenhouses, flowers and vegetables,Temperature and humidity, electrical conductivity,pH test. 


Features ■ Soil water content, electrical conductivity, temperature, PH value,N,P,K are all in one. ■ Low threshold, few steps, fast measurement, no reagents required, unlimited number of tests. ■ The electrode is made of alloy material with special treatment, which can withstand strong external impact and is not easy to be damaged. ■ Completely sealed, resistant to acid and alkali corrosion, and can be buried in soil for long-term dynamic testing. ■ High precision, fast response, good interchangeability, probe insertion design ensures accurate measurement and reliable performance. ■ It can also be used for the conductivity of water and fertilizer integrated solution, as well as other nutrient solutions and substrates. ■ PH value measurement accuracy is high, up to ±0.3PH accuracy, fast response, good interchangeability.
