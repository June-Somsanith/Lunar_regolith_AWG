# Regolith simulant assessment

**Introduction to soil structure analysis**

1. Water content: This refers to the amount of water held in soil, which affects the availability of water to plants and soil microorganisms. Too much water can lead to oxygen deprivation and root rot, while too little water can cause drought stress.
2. Electrical conductivity: This measures the ability of the soil solution to conduct electricity, which is influenced by the concentration of dissolved salts. High levels of electrical conductivity can indicate salinity or nutrient imbalances, which can be harmful to plants.
3. pH: This measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, which affects nutrient availability and microbial activity. Different plants thrive in different pH ranges, so it is important to monitor and adjust soil pH as needed.
4. NPK: This refers to the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil, which are essential macronutrients for plant growth. These nutrients are often added to soil through fertilization, and their availability can be influenced by factors such as pH and organic matter content.
5. Physical disturbance of substrate: This refers to the extent to which the soil structure has been disrupted, which can affect water and nutrient availability, as well as soil microbial activity. Physical disturbance can be caused by factors such as tillage, compaction, or erosion, and can be minimized through practices such as no-till agriculture or cover cropping.



**Engineering a new tool to assess the environment**

**The** CoSE Lunar Large Lander Regolith probe prototype was used to generate quantitative data about a range of soil properties that are important for plant growth. 15ml volume of sample substrate was measured using a sterile 15ml falcon tube and was used to measure and decant substrate into an acrylic pouch that maximized the contact of the substrate and the probes. 5ml of water was then added at \~5 minute intervals as the proves take measurements at 15 second intervals.

## Cross Sensitivity of AO2 Sensor

The following data is provided for general guidance and does not constitute a part of the official product specifications. It is important to note that these values are derived from tests on a limited number of sensors, and variations may occur between batches. To achieve the highest accuracy, it is recommended to calibrate instruments with the specific gas being measured.

The AO2 sensor has been evaluated for cross sensitivity with several gases commonly found in automotive exhaust. Below is an overview of the cross interference levels detected for each gas.

* **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: 16% Concentration in N2 - O2 Equivalent: <0.1%
* **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: 6% Concentration in N2 - O2 Equivalent: <0.1%
* **Nitric Oxide (NO)**: 3000 ppm in N2 - O2 Equivalent: <0.1%
* **n-Hexane**: 2000 ppm in N2 - O2 Equivalent: <0.1%
* **Hydrogen (H2)**: 5000 ppm in N2 - O2 Equivalent: <0.1%

This information serves as a reference to understand potential cross sensitivities but should not replace proper calibration and testing with the target gas for precise measurements.
